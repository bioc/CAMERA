CHANGES IN VERSION 1.23.2
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fix bug in generateRules() if no ions matching the polarity are provided explicitly

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.23.1
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fix bug in generateRules() with empty neutraladditions

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.20.1
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added possibility to pass cor_exp_th from annotateDiffreport to groupCorr()

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.20.0
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Version bump for BioC release

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.19.1
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug in the generateRules function, where in the negative mode
      rules with polycharged positve ions are not created

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.5
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


    o MPI Version of findAdducts() should now consume a lot less memory then before

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.4
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o findKendrickMass() now allows negative retention time windows,
      essentially allowing homologous series of losses

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.15.1
--------------------------

BUG FIXES
  
    o Fix in findIsotopes, where sometime peak with huge m/z differences where annotated as isotopes

-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES


    o findNeutralLossSpecs and findNeutral now accepts multiple masses and use correctly the ppm error

-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  
    o Add igraph package to the dependencies

BUG FIXES

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.7
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed problem in findIsotopes with a previous grouped single sample xcmsSet

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.6
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o  Fixed problem in findAdducts where higher nM+x annotations were erroneous deleted
